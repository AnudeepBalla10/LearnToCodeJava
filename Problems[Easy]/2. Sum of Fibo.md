  ```Java
  public class EvenFibonacciSum {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int sum = 0;
        int a = 1; // First term
        int b = 2; // Second term
        while (b <= 4000000) {
            if (b % 2 == 0) {
                sum += b;
            }
            int nextTerm = a + b;
            a = b;
            b = nextTerm;
        }
        System.out.println("Sum of even-valued Fibonacci terms not exceeding 4 million: " + sum);
    }
}

  ```
To get a more efficient solution we observe every 3rd element in the Fibonacci sequence is an even number, we can keep adding the third digit to the sum;
```
Fibo  ->> 1  1  `2`  3  5  `8`  13  21  `34`  55  89


index ->> 1  2  `3`  4  5  `6`  7   8   `9`   10  11
```
