To get a more efficient solution:

*  First, remove all factors of 2, which is the only even prime number.
*  Then, starting from 3, check for prime factors in increments of 2 (to skip even numbers).
* For each prime factor found, divide the number by that factor as many times as possible.
* Once a prime factor is found, update the upper limit for checking factors to the square root of the current number, as any factor larger than the square root would have a corresponding factor smaller than the square root.
* The largest prime factor is the largest factor found, or the remaining number if no more factors are found.
