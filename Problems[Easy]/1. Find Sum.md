# Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000

A simple way to do this is to go through all numbers from 1 to 999 and test whether they are
divisible by 3 or by 5.

           int x = getMultiple(1000);
            System.out.println(x);
        }
        
        public static int getMultiple(int n){
            int sum = 0;
            for(int i =1; i< n;i++){
                if(i%3 ==0 || i%5 == 0){
                    sum += i;
                }
            }
            return sum;
        }
    }
  ```


To get a more efficient solution you could also calculate the sum of the numbers less
than 1000 that are divisible by 3, plus the sum of the numbers less than 1000 that are divisible
by 5. But as you have summed numbers divisible by 15 twice you would have to subtract the
sum of the numbers divisible by 15.

                sum += getSumOfMultiple(3,limit - 1);
                sum += getSumOfMultiple(5,limit - 1);
                sum -= getSumOfMultiple(15,limit - 1);

                return multiple * n * (n + 1) / 2;
            }
        }
